        <h2>What am I doing with your data?</h2>
        <hr>
        <h3>1. What's collected?</h3>
        <p>This site uses the Apache2 webserver and thus, for every request received, the following is logged:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>IP address</li>
            <li>Request time</li>
            <li>Request type</li>
            <li>Location of requested resource</li>
            <li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Referer">Referrer</a> (what website linked you to this one)</li>
            <li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/User-Agent">User Agent</a> (Type and version of your web browser, often also operating system and version)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>My website doesn't collect any more than stated above (except MediaWiki maybe)</p><br>
        <h3>2. Why are logs kept?</h3>
        <p>So I can examine and prevent attacks such as spam or DDoS-ing attempts</p><br>
        <h3>3. When are the logs analyzed?</h3>
        <p>Usually, unless I suspect an attack of some kind, I won't actively spend hours perusing the logs.</p><br>
        <h3>4. Can I opt-out?</h3>
        <p>Maybe? If you want to, you can email <a href="mailto:wehmaster@weh.moe">wehmaster@weh.moe</a> and I'll try and sort it out as fast as possible (assuming I can figure out how)</p><br>
        <address>Any outlinks and hotlinked/embedded resources are subject to their own privacy policies and have nothing to do with me.</address>
